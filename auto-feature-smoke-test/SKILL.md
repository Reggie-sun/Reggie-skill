description: "Use this skill after implementing a feature, bug fix, or flow change in this repository. Run a small validation pass before final handoff: targeted API verification for the changed surface and a Chrome MCP smoke test when a localhost UI flow is involved. Trigger for frontend/backend integration work, upload/retrieval/chat flows, form interactions, button behavior, and any user-facing local web page change. Skip only for docs-only work or changes with no runnable behavior."

# Auto Feature Smoke Test

Run this skill after a logical feature slice is implemented, not after every file save.

## Required validation

- If the change affects an API or backend behavior, run one targeted verification against the affected endpoint or the smallest relevant automated test.
- If the change affects a local UI or an end-to-end user flow, open the affected localhost or `127.0.0.1` page with Chrome MCP and exercise the changed path.
- If the change is docs-only or has no runnable surface, explicitly say the smoke test is not applicable.

## Workflow

1. Identify the changed surface.
   Examples:
   - upload flow
   - health check
   - retrieval
   - chat
   - a form button
   - a new page interaction

2. Choose the smallest reliable check.
   Prefer:
   - one focused API request
   - one focused pytest target
   - one focused Chrome MCP path

3. Run API verification when applicable.
   Check:
   - HTTP status
   - expected fields
   - obvious error payloads

4. Run Chrome MCP smoke test when UI is involved.
   Do the minimum path needed to prove the changed behavior works.
   Examples:
   - open the page
   - click the changed button
   - fill the changed form
   - upload one small test file when the feature requires it

5. If the smoke test fails and the failure is directly caused by the current change, make the smallest focused fix and rerun once.

6. Report the result in the final handoff.
   Include:
   - what was tested
   - whether API verification passed
   - whether Chrome MCP smoke passed
   - what was skipped and why

## Guardrails

- Do not claim a smoke test passed unless you actually ran it.
- Do not require a fresh upload if the feature can validly run against already persisted data.
- If a current `doc_id` is unavailable after page refresh, prefer testing full-library behavior before forcing a re-upload.
- Do not perform a broad refactor just to satisfy smoke coverage.
- If the UI depends on a local page and the port is unknown, inspect repo config, run scripts, compose files, or recent user instructions first.
- If the page or dependency is not running, state that clearly and report the smoke test as blocked rather than silently skipping it.

## Failure handling

- First try a focused fix when the failure is clearly inside the changed scope.
- Do not rewrite unrelated modules.
- Do not change architecture during smoke fixing.
- If blocked by missing services, auth, data, or environment state, report the exact blocker.

## Default report shape

Use a short result summary like:

- API verification: passed / failed / not applicable
- Chrome MCP smoke: passed / failed / blocked / not applicable
- Notes: one to three concrete lines
