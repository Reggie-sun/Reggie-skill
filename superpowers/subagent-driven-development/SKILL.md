# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching a fresh implementer subagent per task, a task review (spec compliance + code quality) after each, and a broad whole-branch review at the end.

**Why subagents:** You delegate tasks to specialized agents with isolated context. By precisely crafting their instructions and context, you ensure they stay focused and succeed at their task. They should never inherit your session's context or history — you construct exactly what they need. This also preserves your own context for coordination work.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + task review (spec + quality) + broad final review = high quality, fast iteration

**Narration:** between tool calls, narrate at most one short line — the
ledger and the tool results carry the record.

**Continuous execution:** Do not pause between tasks merely for ceremony.
Continue while the next action is authorized, reversible, in scope, and
supported by the accepted spec and repository contracts.

**Bounded rulings.** The controller may decide only reversible, in-scope
implementation details that do not alter accepted behavior, contracts,
ownership, security posture, or user-visible scope. Record each decision in
the ledger as `Ruling: <what you decided> — <why> — <what it costs if wrong>`.

Stop and ask when execution requires an irreversible or destructive action,
a security-sensitive action, an external side effect that requires approval,
a high-risk decision, scope expansion, a contract or higher-authority rule
change, materially unresolved user intent, or a plan so broken that every
path forward is a guess. The active Global/Repository stop conditions remain
authoritative.

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Have implementation plan?" [shape=diamond];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" [shape=diamond];
    "Stay in this session?" [shape=diamond];
    "subagent-driven-development" [shape=box];
    "executing-plans" [shape=box];
    "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [shape=box];

    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Tasks mostly independent?" [label="yes"];
    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Stay in this session?" [label="yes"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no - tightly coupled"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "subagent-driven-development" [label="yes"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "executing-plans" [label="no - parallel session"];
}
```

**vs. Executing Plans (parallel session):**
- Same session (no context switch)
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution)
- Review after each task (spec compliance + code quality), broad review at the end
- Faster iteration (no human-in-loop between tasks)

## Setup

Apply the repository/global Git lane policy before execution. A written plan
or this skill alone is not a worktree trigger. When that policy requires
isolation, use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create or verify it; when it
allows serial work on the primary branch, proceed there without adding a
second workspace policy.

Conversation memory does not survive compaction. In real sessions,
controllers that lost their place have re-dispatched entire completed task
sequences — the single most expensive failure observed. Track progress in
a ledger file, not only in todos.

- Each plan owns a workspace: at skill start, run this skill's
  `scripts/sdd-workspace PLAN_FILE` — it prints the plan's git-ignored
  directory (`<repo-root>/.superpowers/sdd/<plan-basename>/`), home to
  every artifact for THIS plan: ledger, briefs, reports, review packages.
  Another plan's directory is never yours to read or write.
- Check for this plan's ledger at `<workspace>/progress.md`. If its first
  line names your plan file, tasks with a `Task <N>: complete` line are DONE
  — do not re-dispatch them; resume at the first task without one. A task
  whose last line is a fix round is mid-loop: resume the loop at the next
  round. A ledger whose first line names a different plan file — or a stray
  ledger at the old flat path `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md` — is another
  plan's progress: leave it in place and start your own, fresh.
- Create the ledger with its identity as the first line:
  `# SDD ledger — plan: <plan file path>`.
- The ledger is your recovery map: the commits it names exist in git even
  when your context no longer remembers creating them. After compaction,
  trust the ledger and `git log` over your own recollection.
- `git clean -fdx` will destroy the workspace (it's git-ignored scratch); if
  that happens, recover from `git log`.

Read the plan once, note its context and Global Constraints, and create a
todo per task. If the plan names a Spec, read that too: the spec is the
authority the plan argues from, and conflicts inside the plan resolve
against it. A plan with no reachable spec gets a ledger note saying so —
rulings made without one are provisional.

Before dispatching Task 1, scan the plan once for conflicts, writing down
what you checked as you check it:

- tasks that contradict each other or the plan's Global Constraints
- anything the plan explicitly mandates that the review rubric treats as a
  defect (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic block)

The scan's output is a table, not a verdict. One row for every pair of tasks
that share a file or an interface: the two tasks, what one produces against
what the other consumes, and what you found. One row for every task: whether
its own text agrees with itself — the tests it specifies against the code it
specifies, the files it creates against the files it later touches. "The scan
is clean" without those rows is not a scan you ran.

Write the table to the ledger. Resolve only bounded implementation-detail
conflicts before execution and record each ruling. If a conflict would change
scope, contract, accepted behavior, ownership, or another higher-authority
decision, stop for direction instead of rewriting the plan by ruling. If the
scan is clean, proceed without comment. The review loop remains the net for
conflicts that only emerge from implementation.

## Dispatch Backend

This local fork composes the installed `sub-agents` skill as a dispatch
adapter when this workflow has already been selected. The adapter owns only
transport and agent-definition selection; the v6 ledger, task brief, review
package, fix loop, and final review remain the lifecycle owner.

Use MiniMax external as the primary backend for bounded exploration and
implementation when higher-authority host and repository rules permit it.
Use the native named `reviewer` profile for every review gate:

1. Read `/home/reggie/.codex/skills/sub-agents/SKILL.md` and its Codex
   reference before the first dispatch.
2. Resolve `explorer` and `writer` independently. List definitions against the active
   workspace with `run_subagent.py --list --cwd <workspace>`; a matching
   `<workspace>/.agents/<role>.md` wins for that role.
3. For each missing role, list and dispatch it with the explicit host fallback
   `--agents-dir /home/reggie/.agents`. The runner does not infer this
   fallback. In a mixed setup, project and host roles therefore use separate
   invocations rather than one directory replacing the other.
4. Inspect the selected definitions before dispatch. `explorer` must be
   `permission: read-only`; `writer` must permit the assigned edit and remain
   bounded to explicit ownership. Treat a role that violates these constraints
   as unavailable.
5. When pre-implementation mapping materially reduces uncertainty, use the
   external `explorer`; do not add an explorer to mechanical tasks. Use the
   external `writer` for implementation and fix rounds. Use the native named
   `reviewer` for task review, scoped re-review, and final review.

Pass `--dialogue` on every external explorer and writer dispatch. This enables
bounded turn-taking through a strict task-state envelope; it does not create an
interactive process or persistent session.

The selected external definition owns any declared `run-agent`, `model`, `effort`,
`timeout`, and `permission`; omitted fields use the runner's documented
defaults. Do not pass `--cli`, model, effort, or a shorter timeout unless a
higher-authority instruction explicitly overrides the definition. Give a
writer exact file ownership, include its report path, and explicitly state
whether task-only staging and commit are authorized. Build an exact command
grant list before dispatch. Pass each owned path as a repeated `--allow-path`
and each command as a repeated `--allow-command`; include only the focused
tests and task-only Git commands the writer is authorized to run. Neither
external role may dispatch subagents. Native reviewers remain strictly
read-only.

External invocations are fresh and stateless. Every fix dispatch therefore
includes the task brief path, report path, current state, and exact open
findings; use the report as persistent memory rather than assuming session
resume. Keep `run_subagent.py` attached until it returns terminal JSON. Its
transport idle timeout is distinct from the read-only Claude-family
120-second semantic-stagnation limit: repeated identical heartbeats or
semantically identical `tool_result` events show liveness but do not count as
progress. Safe-edit writers use their transport idle timeout so a legitimate
long-running test is not killed at 120 seconds; the same configured timeout
also caps semantically stagnant retries, so repeated denials cannot run
forever by emitting heartbeats.

Treat transport `status` and task `agent_status` as separate gates. A transport
`success` is not completion unless `agent_status` is `DONE` or
`DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`. On `NEEDS_CONTEXT`, inspect the current diff before
answering, require one to three precise questions, and place the answer in a
non-secret UTF-8 artifact inside the task workspace. Fresh-dispatch the same
task, report path, current state, ownership, command grants, and open findings
with `--dialogue --parent-answer-file <artifact>`. Never include that artifact
in `--allow-path`: it supplies context and grants no capability. Allow at most
three clarification rounds for one task; then stop for direction or make a
disclosed capability-based fallback. `NEEDS_CONTEXT` is a dialogue turn, not a
backend failure or the one bounded failure retry below.

If the runner returns `PROTOCOL_ERROR`, correct the protocol instruction and
make one fresh retry. Never infer DONE from prose, Markdown, a clean diff, or a
successful transport response. A material unresolved decision requires
`NEEDS_CONTEXT` before source edits; if the agent edited first, inspect those
changes as potentially invalid and do not silently adopt them.

Do not switch away from MiniMax merely because one invocation times out,
requests an ungranted command, or returns an incomplete report. Diagnose the
terminal result, narrow the task or add the exact missing command when it is
authorized, and make one bounded fresh retry with the full artifact-backed
context. Fall back to a native explorer or writer only after that retry ends
in a genuine runner/backend failure, a higher-authority rule conflicts, or
the task requires a capability the external definition cannot provide. State
the exact fallback reason. Native review is the designed review lane, not a
fallback. The controller remains responsible for the final diff,
verification evidence, and all lifecycle rulings regardless of backend.

## Model Selection

This section controls native dispatches, including all reviewers. With the
external explorer/writer adapter, the selected agent definition owns model
and effort. If rounds 4-5 require a
capability tier that no external definition provides, select an appropriate
separate definition or make and disclose a capability-based native fallback;
do not silently override the configured model.

Use the least powerful model that can handle each role to conserve cost and increase speed.

**Mechanical implementation tasks** (isolated functions, clear specs, 1-2 files): use a fast, cheap model. Most implementation tasks are mechanical when the plan is well-specified.

**Integration and judgment tasks** (multi-file coordination, pattern matching, debugging): use a standard model.

**Architecture and design tasks**: use the most capable available model.
The final whole-branch review is one of these — dispatch it on the most
capable available model, not the session default.

**Review tasks**: choose the model with the same judgment, scaled to the
diff's size, complexity, and risk. A small mechanical diff does not need the
most capable model; a subtle concurrency change does. Scoped re-reviews of
small fix diffs take a cheap-to-mid tier.

**Fix-loop escalation (rounds 4-5)**: use a model at least one tier above
the implementer that got stuck.

**For native dispatches, obey the platform profile contract.** A named profile
with fixed model/effort owns those settings; do not override it. For a raw or
general native dispatch whose interface supports model selection, specify the
model and `reasoning_effort` together so it does not silently inherit an
unsuitable session model or reset effort. External definitions remain
definition-owned as described above.

**Turn count beats token price.** Wall-clock and context cost scale with how
many turns a subagent takes, and the cheapest models routinely take 2-3× the
turns on multi-step work — costing more overall. Use a mid-tier model as the
floor for reviewers and for implementers working from prose descriptions.
When the task's plan text contains the complete code to write, the
implementation is transcription plus testing: use the cheapest tier for
that implementer. Single-file mechanical fixes also take the cheapest tier.

**Task complexity signals (implementation tasks):**
- Touches 1-2 files with a complete spec → cheap model
- Touches multiple files with integration concerns → standard model
- Requires design judgment or broad codebase understanding → most capable model

## The Task Loop

**Batch small same-shape work.** When the plan lists several tasks that are
each a small, independent edit of the same kind — the same one-line fix,
constant change, or field addition repeated across files — do not dispatch
one subagent per task. Compose ONE dispatch brief listing every file and
its change, send the whole batch to a single subagent, and review its diff
as one unit. Reserve one-dispatch-per-task for work that needs its own
judgment, its own tests, or its own review surface.

Everything you paste into a dispatch prompt — and everything a subagent
prints back — stays resident in your context for the rest of the session
and is re-read on every later turn. Hand artifacts over as files.

**Waiting on dispatched subagents:** never poll a wait interface with
short timeouts, and never sit in one silent, open-ended wait either.
While you have local work — ledger updates, packaging the next review,
reading reports — keep working; child results arrive on their own.
When you are genuinely idle, wait in bounded stretches (five to ten
minutes, where your platform allows), and between stretches post one
line of status and reconcile your live children: list them, and chase
any that finished without reporting. A bounded stretch keeps nearly
all of a long wait's efficiency while guaranteeing a stuck or lost
child is noticed within minutes, not at the end of the session.

### 1. Dispatch the implementer

Record BASE (`git rev-parse HEAD`) before dispatching — the review package
and fix-round diffs need it.

- **Task brief:** before dispatching an implementer, run this skill's
  `scripts/task-brief PLAN_FILE N` — it extracts the task's full text to a
  uniquely named file and prints the path. Compose the dispatch so the
  brief stays the single source of
  requirements. Your dispatch should contain: (1) one line on where this
  task fits in the project; (2) the brief path, introduced as "read this
  first — it is your requirements, with the exact values to use verbatim";
  (3) interfaces and decisions from earlier tasks that the brief cannot
  know; (4) your resolution of any ambiguity you noticed in the brief;
  (5) the report-file path and report contract. Exact values (numbers,
  magic strings, signatures, test cases) appear only in the brief. Never
  make a subagent read the whole plan file.
- **Report file:** name the implementer's report file after the brief
  (brief `…/task-N-brief.md` → report `…/task-N-report.md`) and put it in
  the dispatch prompt. The implementer writes the full report there and
  returns only status, commits, a one-line test summary, and concerns.
- A dispatch prompt describes one task, not the session's history. Do not
  paste accumulated prior-task summaries ("state after Tasks 1-3") into
  later dispatches — a real session's dispatch hit 42k chars of which 99%
  was pasted history. A fresh subagent needs its task, the interfaces it
  touches, and the global constraints. Nothing else.
- The dispatch carries the no-subagents contract (it is in the
  implementer template): the implementer never dispatches subagents —
  not helpers, and never a reviewer. Review arrives from you, after the
  report. In real sessions, every reviewer a worker spawned duplicated
  the task review the controller dispatched anyway — a full extra
  review seat per task.
- If an earlier task parked a finding in the area this task touches, carry
  a pointer to that ledger entry in the dispatch.
- For native dispatch, record the implementer's agent identity — fix-loop
  rounds 1-3 resume this agent. External CLI dispatches are stateless and use
  the report-backed fresh-dispatch route described above.
- Never dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts).
- This workflow reviews committed diffs. For every external writer dispatch,
  authorize task-only `git add <exact paths>` and one exact
  `git commit --only -m <message> -- <owned paths>` command unless a
  higher-authority Git rule forbids agent commits. The `--only` pathspec is
  mandatory so pre-existing staged work cannot enter the task commit. If
  commits are forbidden, stop before dispatch: the current `BASE..HEAD`
  review package cannot represent uncommitted work. After the writer returns
  DONE, require `HEAD != BASE` and verify the entire `BASE..HEAD` path set is
  owned before generating the review package.

Template: [implementer-prompt.md](implementer-prompt.md)

### 2. Handle the report

Implementer subagents report one of four statuses. Handle each appropriately:

**DONE:** Generate the review package (`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD`, from this skill's directory — it prints the unique file path it wrote; BASE is the commit you recorded before dispatching the implementer — never `HEAD~1`, which silently drops all but the last commit of a multi-commit task), then dispatch the task reviewer with the printed path.

`DONE` is an agent claim, not verification evidence. Before review packaging,
the controller must inspect the owned diff and independently check the focused
acceptance evidence. If either contradicts the report, fresh-dispatch a scoped
fix with the exact observed mismatch; do not promote the task to review.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** The implementer completed the work but flagged doubts. Read the concerns before proceeding. If the concerns are about correctness or scope, address them before review. If they're observations (e.g., "this file is getting large"), note them and proceed to review.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** The implementer needs information that wasn't provided.
Inspect the current diff, answer all one-to-three questions in a validated
artifact, and fresh-dispatch with the same scope and explicit permissions using
`--dialogue --parent-answer-file`. Do not treat this as a backend failure retry,
and do not let the answer artifact expand edit or command authority.

**BLOCKED:** The implementer cannot complete the task. Assess the blocker:
1. If it's a context problem, provide more context and re-dispatch with the same model
2. If the task requires more reasoning, re-dispatch with a more capable model
3. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces
4. If the plan itself is wrong, apply the bounded-ruling rule above; otherwise
   stop for direction before changing it

**Never** ignore an escalation or force the same model to retry without changes. If the implementer said it's stuck, something needs to change.

If the implementer asks questions — before starting or mid-task — answer
clearly and completely, provide additional context if needed, and don't
rush it into implementation.

### 3. Review the task

Per-task reviews are task-scoped gates. The broad review happens once, at the
final whole-branch review. Never skip the task review, and never accept a
report missing either verdict — spec compliance AND task quality are both
required. Implementer self-review never replaces the task review; both are
needed.

- Hand the reviewer its diff as a file: run this skill's
  `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD` and pass the reviewer the file path
  it prints (or, without bash: `git log --oneline`, `git diff --stat`,
  and `git diff -U10` for the range, redirected to one uniquely named
  file). The output never enters your own context, and the reviewer sees
  the commit list, stat summary, and full diff with context in one Read
  call. Use the BASE you recorded before dispatching the implementer —
  never `HEAD~1`, which silently truncates multi-commit tasks. Never
  dispatch a task reviewer without a diff file.
- **Reviewer inputs:** the task reviewer gets three paths — the same brief
  file, the report file, and the review package — plus the global
  constraints that bind the task.
- The global-constraints block you hand the reviewer is its attention
  lens. Copy the binding requirements verbatim from the plan's Global
  Constraints section or the spec: exact values, exact formats, and the
  stated relationships between components ("same layout as X", "matches
  Y"). The reviewer's template already carries the process rules (YAGNI,
  test hygiene, review method) — the constraints block is for what THIS
  project's spec demands.
- Do not add open-ended directives like "check all uses" or "run race tests
  if useful" without a concrete, task-specific reason
- Do not ask a reviewer to re-run tests the implementer already ran on the
  same code — the implementer's report carries the test evidence
- Do not pre-judge findings for the reviewer — never instruct a reviewer to
  ignore or not flag a specific issue. If you believe a finding would be a
  false positive, let the reviewer raise it and adjudicate it in the review
  loop. If the prompt you are writing contains "do not flag," "don't treat X
  as a defect," "at most Minor," or "the plan chose" — stop: you are
  pre-judging, usually to spare yourself a review loop.
The task reviewer may report "⚠️ Cannot verify from diff" items — requirements
that live in unchanged code or span tasks. These do not block the rest of the
review, but you must resolve each one yourself before marking the task
complete: you hold the plan and cross-task context the reviewer
lacks. If you confirm an item is a real gap, treat it as a failed spec
review — it enters the fix loop with the other findings.

Template: [task-reviewer-prompt.md](task-reviewer-prompt.md)

Dispatch this gate with the native named `reviewer` profile. Do not route it
through the external `reviewer` definition.

### 4. The fix loop

The loop triggers when the review reports spec ❌, any Critical or Important
finding, or a ⚠️ item you confirmed as a real gap.

Before the loop starts, two routes leave it immediately:

- Record Minor findings in the progress ledger as you go
  (`Task <N>: minor (deferred): <one-liner>`), and point the final
  whole-branch review at that list so it can triage which must be fixed
  before merge. A roll-up nobody reads is a silent discard. Minor findings
  never enter the loop.
- A finding labeled plan-mandated — or any finding that conflicts with
  what the plan's text requires — follows the bounded-ruling rule. Weigh it
  against the accepted spec, ledger an in-scope implementation ruling, or
  stop when resolving it would alter a higher-authority decision.
Everything else enters the loop. A fix round is one fix dispatch plus one
scoped re-review. Five rounds maximum per task:

**Rounds 1-3 — resume the original implementer when the backend supports
resume.** Send it the open findings verbatim. Its context is intact: it knows
the task, the code, and its own choices. External CLI invocations and other
stateless backends dispatch a fresh implementer carrying the brief path, the
report-file path, the current state, and the findings — the report file is
the persistent memory either way.

**Rounds 4-5 — dispatch a fresh implementer on a more capable model** (per
Model Selection), with the brief path, the report-file path, the open
findings, and this framing: "A prior implementer attempted this task
[N] times; you own it now. Read the report file for what was tried." A loop
that survives three resumes usually means the implementer cannot see its
own problem — fresh eyes and a capability bump in one move.

**Every round, either way:** the implementer fixes, re-runs the tests
covering the amended code, appends its fix report to the same report file,
and returns the short contract. Before re-dispatching the reviewer, confirm
the fix report contains the covering tests, the command run, and the
output; dispatch the re-review once all three are present. Name the
covering test files in the fix message — a one-line fix does not need the
whole suite.

**The re-review is scoped.** Run `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD`
where FIX_BASE is the head the previous review saw, and dispatch
[re-review-prompt.md](re-review-prompt.md) with the findings list, the
brief, the report file, and the printed diff path. The re-reviewer verdicts
each finding ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED and flags new breakage in the fix
diff only. New Critical/Important breakage in the fix diff joins the open
findings list. Out-of-scope observations go to the ledger as deferred
minors — they never extend the loop.
Dispatch every re-review through the native named `reviewer` profile.

**After each round,** append to the ledger:
`Task <N>: fix round <R>/5 (<X> addressed, <Y> open — <finding one-liners>; commits <a7>..<b7>)`

Never fix findings yourself in the controller session — your context stays
clean for coordination, and controller fixes skip review.

**The breaker.** When round 5's re-review still leaves findings open, stop
dispatching. Adjudicate each open finding yourself — you hold the plan and
the cross-task context the reviewer lacks:

- **The reviewer is wrong, or the point is contestable:** park it —
  `Task <N>: parked — <finding> — Ruling: <why the code stands>`. The final
  review sees both sides.
- **Real, but nothing downstream builds on it:** park it the same way, with
  a ruling that says it's real and deferred.
- **Real and load-bearing** — a later task builds on it, or it reveals a
  plan defect: apply only a reversible, in-scope implementation ruling. If
  the smallest correction changes scope, contract, accepted behavior, or a
  higher-authority decision, stop for direction. Never park a structural
  failure and let dependent tasks build on it.

Adjudicate only at the cap. Adjudicating earlier to end a loop is
pre-judging with a different name. Every adjudication is a ledger entry —
a silent discard is forbidden.

### 5. Complete the task

When the review comes back clean — or every open finding is parked with a
ruling at the cap — append the completion line to the ledger in the same
message as your other bookkeeping:

- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, review clean)`
- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, <K> parked)` after a
  tripped breaker

Then mark the todo complete and move on. Never move to the next task while
the review has open Critical/Important issues that are neither fixed nor
parked-with-ruling at the cap.

## Final Review

The final whole-branch review gets a package too: run
`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE MERGE_BASE HEAD` (MERGE_BASE = the commit the
branch started from, e.g. `git merge-base main HEAD`) and include the
printed path in the final review dispatch, so the final reviewer reads
one file instead of re-deriving the branch diff with git commands. Dispatch
the native named `reviewer` profile at its fixed capability settings. Use
superpowers:requesting-code-review's
[code-reviewer.md](../requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md). Point it at
the ledger's deferred-minor and parked lines so it can triage which must be
fixed before merge.

If the final whole-branch review returns findings, dispatch ONE fix subagent
with the complete findings list — not one fixer per finding.
Per-finding fixers each rebuild context and re-run suites; a real
session's final-review fix wave cost more than all its tasks combined.
Then run exactly one scoped re-review of the fix wave
(`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD` over the fix range,
[re-review-prompt.md](re-review-prompt.md)).
Adjudicate any residual findings as in the task loop's breaker: park
non-blocking findings with bounded rulings. A load-bearing finding that would
change scope, contract, accepted behavior, or another higher-authority
decision must stop for user direction. There is no second fix wave; unresolved
findings surface during the final handoff and prevent an unqualified success
claim.

## Finish

Before you delete anything, collect every ledger line containing `Ruling:` —
preflight rulings, parked findings, breaker adjudications, all of them — into
your final message under "Rulings I made", in the order you made them, each
with what it costs if wrong. The list is exhaustive: if the ledger holds a
ruling, the list holds it. That list is the only place the decisions you
took on your human partner's behalf reach them — they read it and rework
whatever you got wrong. A ruling that dies with the workspace was a decision
made in secret.

When the final whole-branch review is clean and its fixes are integrated,
delete this plan's workspace (`rm -rf <workspace>`) — the git history is
the record now. Sibling directories belong to other plans; leave them
alone.

If execution used a feature branch or worktree, use
superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch. On the repository's primary
branch, inspect the final diff and status, follow repository commit rules,
and report the verified result without a branch-finishing ceremony.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Close enough on spec compliance" | Reviewer found spec gaps = not done. Fix or hit the cap and adjudicate — those are the only exits. |
| "I'll fix it myself, dispatching is overhead" | Controller fixes pollute your context and skip review. Resume the implementer. |
| "One more round will converge" | Past the cap, rounds don't converge — the failure is structural. Adjudicate and route. |
| "The reviewer will just find something new anyway" | Scoped re-reviews verify fixes; they cannot wander. New findings on untouched code go to the ledger, not the loop. |
| "This finding is obviously wrong, I'll drop it" | You adjudicate only at the cap, and every ruling is a ledger entry. Silent discards are forbidden. |
| "The fix was small, skip the re-review" | Unreviewed fixes are how regressions land. Every round ends with a scoped re-review. |
| "Reviews slow the loop down" | The loop without reviews is just unverified churn. Reviews are the loop's brakes and steering. |
| "Ledger bookkeeping is overhead" | The ledger is what survives compaction. Controllers without one have re-dispatched entire completed task sequences. |
| "The implementer spawned its own reviewer — free extra assurance" | It's a duplicate seat reviewing the same diff; the task review is the gate. A worker-spawned reviewer is a defect to flag, not rigor. |

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Setup: repository-authorized workspace verified]
[Read plan file once: docs/superpowers/plans/feature-plan.md]
[Resolve workspace: scripts/sdd-workspace docs/superpowers/plans/feature-plan.md — no ledger inside, fresh start]
[Create todos for all tasks]

Task 1: Hook installation script

[Run task-brief for Task 1; dispatch implementer with brief + report paths + context]

Implementer: "Before I begin - should the hook be installed at user or system level?"

You: "User level (~/.config/superpowers/hooks/)"

Implementer: [Later]
  - Implemented install-hook command
  - Added tests, 5/5 passing
  - Self-review: Found I missed --force flag, added it
  - Committed

[Run review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD; dispatch task reviewer with the printed path]
Task reviewer: Spec ✅ - all requirements met, nothing extra.
  Strengths: Good test coverage, clean. Issues: None. Task quality: Approved.

[Ledger: Task 1: complete (commits a1b2c3d..d4e5f6a, review clean)]

Task 2: Recovery modes

[Run task-brief for Task 2; dispatch implementer with brief + report paths + context]

Implementer: [No questions]
  - Added verify/repair modes
  - 8/8 tests passing
  - Committed

[Run review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD; dispatch task reviewer with the printed path]
Task reviewer: Spec ❌:
  - Missing: Progress reporting (spec says "report every 100 items")
  Issues (Important): Magic number (100)

[Fix round 1: resume the implementer with both findings]
Implementer: Added progress reporting, extracted PROGRESS_INTERVAL constant.
  Re-ran test/recovery.test.js — 10/10 passing. Fix report appended.

[Run review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD; dispatch scoped re-review]
Re-reviewer: Missing progress reporting — ADDRESSED (src/recovery.js:41).
  Magic number — ADDRESSED (src/recovery.js:7). New breakage: none.
  Verdict: all findings addressed.

[Ledger: Task 2: fix round 1/5 (2 addressed, 0 open; commits d4e5f6a..b7c8d9e)]
[Ledger: Task 2: complete (commits d4e5f6a..b7c8d9e, review clean)]

...

[After all tasks]
[Run review-package PLAN_FILE MERGE_BASE HEAD; dispatch final code-reviewer, most capable model]
Final reviewer: All requirements met. Deferred minors triaged: none block merge.

[Delete this plan's workspace — the record now lives in git]

Done! Using superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch.
```
